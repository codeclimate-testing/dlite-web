Feature: Timeout on the app after authenticating
As a DMV customer
I want the log-out functionality to work

# Scenario: Clicking the log-out link to log-out
#   Given I go to the new online DL application
#   When I go to the IDDL sign-in page
#   And I go to the logged in page
#   When I click the log-out link
#   And I will not see sign-in in the url
#   And I will not see any log-out link

# Scenario: language choice persisted
#   Given I go to the new online DL application
#   When I visit the page to choose application language
#   And I choose Thai as my application language
#   And I click to continue
#   When I go to the IDDL sign-in page
#   And I go to the logged in page
#   When I click the log-out link
#   Then I will be on the id.me page
#   When I go to the logged in page
#   Then the name page will be in Thai
