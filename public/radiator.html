      <h1>DLite Information Page</h1>
      <p>
        DLite is the Motor Votor effort to bring the DL 44 application process online.
        The project is a joint effort between the DMV, Secretary of State and the California Department of Technology.
        Below are some links to important tools and documents that we are using to get our work done.

          <h3>Product</h3>
          <p>
            The product owner hold the vision for the whole end-to-end software product and experience.
            The role acts as the arbiter for competing stakeholder and business needs. Product management
            is similar to project management in that it removes blockers and keeps an eye on the overall scope.
            It is different because it is a hands-on role, strategically making decisions on what the product will be.
            Product owners will direct design and research efforts, while also translating these outcomes to the development team.

                Stories are written by the design team and prioritized in conjunction with the product leads on a weekly or biweekly basis.

              <h4><a href='https://dlite-web.herokuapp.com/services' target='_blank'>Staging site</a></h4>
              <p>
                The staging site automatically deploys.
                First, developers merge a group of commits into the master branch of our source code.
                Our continuous integration tests kick off, and if the tests are successful the code is deployed
                directly to our staging server on heroku.
              </p>

              <p>
                That means that this site is the bleeding edge of development, and features are being released as they are finished.

              <h4><a href='https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2051881' target='_blank'>Stories</a></h4>
              <p>
                Product writes detailed stories for the development team.
                Features, bugs and chores are built in the icebox.
                When they are prioritized and ordered they are put into the current iteration.
                Developers choose full-stack stories from the top of the queue and pair or work on them in solo,
                depending on the complexity of the task. Points on the stories are estimates of complexity.
                Velocity is a measure of how many points can be done in a period of time. The tool, Pivotal Tracker,
                estimates based on recent velocity what will get done in the coming sprint.

              <h4><a href='https://github.com/stateofca/dlite-web' target='_blank'>Source code</a></h4>
              <p>
                Our source code is stored on GitHub, an online source code repository, and it is part of the state's enterprise account.
                The source code is open source, meaning it can be copied and reused without permission.
                It is also public, meaning anyone can see the code and comment on it.

              <h4><a href='https://travis-ci.org/stateofca/dlite-web' target='_blank'>Continuous integration tests</a></h4>
              <p>
                This project uses a continuous integration tool Travis.org that is free for open source projects.
                This testing tool monitors our GitHub repository for changes and kicks off the test suite.
                It reports results back to GitHub so that developers have centralized access when reviewing code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Code coverage is also being automatically broadcast from the test suite. The tools for this integration
                are still being tuned so that we have the best information about coverage on the acceptance, server and client levels.
              </p>

              <h4><a href='https://codeclimate.com/github/stateofca/dlite-web' target='_blank'>Code metrics</a></h4>
              <p>
                Engineering quality is monitored by doing static analysis. This checks for linting errors, complexity,
                and duplication. This combined with code coverage gives a good measure of the overall code quality.
                The tool rates the source code on a 0-4 scale, like a grade point average. The tool also uses a green
                to red color scale.
